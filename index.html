            A tree plantation, forest plantation, plantation forest, timber plantation or tree farm is a forest <br> planted for high volume production of wood, usually by planting one type of tree as a <br> monoculture forest. The term tree farm also is used to refer to tree nurseries and Christmas <br> tree farms. Plantation forestry can produce a high volume of wood in a short period of <br> time.Plantations are grown by state forestry authorities (for example, the Forestry <br> Commission in Britain) and/or the paper and wood industries and other private landowners <br> (such as Weyerhaeuser, Rayonier and Sierra Pacific Industries in the United States or Asia <br> Pulp & Paper in Indonesia). Christmas trees are often grown on plantations, and in southern <br> and southeastern Asia, teak plantations have recently replaced the natural forest. <br>
